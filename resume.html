					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Personal Website </strong>
							<em
								>NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Bootstrap, Sass, React, MongoDB,
								Webpack</em
							>
							<p>
								Built CMS for it, uses CRUD to manage and display posts of
								code/projects
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Streamlined Company Application</strong>
							<em
								>ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Redux
							</em>
							<p>
								User Manager, Order Manager, Shipment Manager, Receiving
								Manager, built in ERP system, website auditor, internal company
								communications, save/track any changes made to anything, tracks
								stagnant prices, orders without a shipping update, identify
								broken links/filters on the product and category pages, track
								payments from customers, to distributors, taxes, etc. Everything
								is uploadable and update-able via CSV, custom user
								authentication system built in Express. Designed middleware
								functions to reduce client resource load, and carefully planned
								out measures to use and pass data between the client and server.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong> URL and CSV loadable Content Spinner </strong>
							<em>NextJS, React, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Bootstrap, Webpack </em>
							<p>
								Scrape a URL or load in a csv potentially containing thousands
								of products, pipe through all the fields and identify specific
								keywords to generate unique and SEO targetted descriptions,
								names, etc. Outputs a new csv with unique information for all
								products put into it, or allowing a queue of URLs to scrape with
								the express custom server, and provide the same result.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Click Scheduler Chrome Extension </strong>
							<em>Javascript, CSS, HTML </em>
							<p>
								Injects a script to call the click() function on an element once
								a specific time is met or exceeded. Absolves the need for an
								expensive cron job product import for our magento website,
								published to the Chrome Web Store for free
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> Bear Alert Chrome Extension </strong>
							<em> Javascript, CSS, HTML, Regex </em>
							<p>
								Injects a script to every page you access, trying to find the
								occurrence of the word "bear", mostly a proof of concept for
								another extension/app combo that I am developing. Has a cool
								stats page to access to see how many "bear"s you've seen, and
								which pages had the most occurences of bears. Published to the
								Chrome Web Store for free and fun.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong> ShopCSV Chrome Extension </strong>
							<em>Javascript, CSS, HTML, Regex </em>
							<p>
								Injects a script on every page you access, you can choose to
								scrape that page, create a csv row, and append it to the total
								CSV file in the background page. Once you've made your
								selection, you can then goto the background page to download the
								CSV file, clearing it out from the extension, and allowing you
								to upload the CSV onto your Magento, Wordpress, Shopify, or
								other e-commerce website/platform, to absolve the tediousness of
								attempting to contact a manufacturer and hope that they have a
								quality dataset to provide you. Future implementations of this
								extension intend to function with a full stack application,
								allowing you to store all the previously created CSV's into a
								webserver, combine as many of them as you like, and connect to
								your stores api to upload the products in real time, without the
								need to generate any CSV files.
