Add a CSS class called "pagebreak" (or "pb"), like so:

@media print {
    .pagebreak { page-break-before: always; } /* page-break-after works, as well */
}
Then add an empty DIV tag (or any block element that generates a box) where you want the page break.

<div class="pagebreak"> </div>
It won't show up on the page, but will break up the page when printing.

P.S. Perhaps this only applies when using -after (and also what else you might be doing with other <div>s on the page), but I found that I had to augment the CSS class as follows:

@media print {
    .pagebreak {
        clear: both;
        page-break-after: always;
    }
}

chrome extension tied to server

scraper profiles are based on domain name

domain names can have many scraper profiles

profiles can have many directory profiles

domain.com/category page has different profile than
domain.com/product

can scrape categories and follow into all products to scrape the product page

figure out how to get inheritence with that
like that the results do not come from the category page, but props are passed from the category page to the product

need restful api, maybe website front end for better management, and saving csvs
